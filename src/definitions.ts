   * The plugin cannot cancel Apple's pending system operation or dismiss its prompt.
   * Android 10+ requests do not require internet access, regardless of autoRouteTraffic.
   * Android SSID verification requires precise location permission and enabled location services.

   * Successful Android 10+ temporary connections are retained until disconnect(), replacement,
   * network loss, or plugin destruction. Failure/cancellation releases the request and
   * any process binding still owned by the plugin.
   * On failure, rejects with a Capacitor error that includes a stable `code`
   * from {@link WifiConnectionErrorCode}. Prefer `error.code` over parsing `error.message`.
   * Specific codes are returned only when the native OS provides that reason;
   * otherwise the plugin returns `CONNECTION_FAILED`.
   * Errors from a started native attempt include optional data.ssidVerification
   * ('unavailable', 'mismatch', or 'match') and data.elapsedMs (Android excludes location authorization).
   * On iOS, SSID observation is included for verification-stage errors.
